colors
======

A little experiment in color (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Sick of not knowing what the names / hex values of colors were I decided to create a little single-page colors app.

RGB has 16 Million (16,581,375) colors.

If you looked at one color per second it would take 192 days to cycle through all the available colors [ 255*255*255/(60*60*24) ]
